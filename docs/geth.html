When I visited the Monastery of the Redentore Church , and saw the tree there,I was told that the tree came from the Garden of Gethsemane, but I don't know its exact age or size.  Since the tree has a religious reference, I painted it on a cross.</h3><pre><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p></pre><h4>&copy; June Julian 1997<br>"Gethsemane Olive"<br>Watercolor on Paper, 1995</h4><br><br><br><br><br><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<br><br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">  jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

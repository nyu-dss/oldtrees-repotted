It is located in Athens,Ohio inside the College Green of Ohio University directly in front ofMemorialAuditorium. I love this specimen of Fraxinus pennsylvanica that is nativeto Ohio and is ranked as one of the largest Green Ash trees in the state.This tree gives off a tremendous sense of power when near. I took the abovepicture looking directly up from the trunk."&nbsp;<br>-Dave House</h3><pre>&nbsp;</pre><h3>&copy; Dave House<br>"The Great Green Ash "<br>Print</h3>photo 1.14"x2.13"<h4>Common Name: Green Ash<br>Latin Name: <i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica<br></i>Circumference: 224 inches<br>Location: Athens, Ohio University College Green</h4><pre>&nbsp;</pre><a href="index-2.html"><img SRC="sparklea.gif"  align=LEFT></a> Return toMain Page<br>&nbsp;<p><br><center><p><a href="comment.html">Comments</a><p>Please send e-mail to: June Julian<a href="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">jj68@nyu.edu</a></center></body></html>

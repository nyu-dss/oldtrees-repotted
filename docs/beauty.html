But they also move among us in our Code Orange city nowadays, and dance this town around quite a bit.</P><P>                From the first time I saw Anemone Dance Theatre perform their Moving Water Theory at the Puffin Room last fall, I knew these were extraordinarily gifted dancers. At the Evolving Arts Theatre in early May, they premiered remember? at Just Move, the anniversary concert for Dance Space, celebrating the downtown center&#146;s nineteen years of service to the dance community. </P><P>                 In remember? Sara Baird, choreographer and Anemone&#146;s co-founder, is Odysseus&#146; sea siren, mesmerizing us with her spell of pure beauty. For a delicious interlude, she and Erin Dudley, move with undulating projections and a hypnotic sound score, to carry each of us to a personal place of luminous vitality and freedom.</P><P>                Beginning as tight huddled packages on the stage, they slowly emerge, like a chrysalis, or an unfurling fern, darkly silhouetted against Lee Whittier&#146;s lusciously patterned video backdrops. Christopher Tignor&#146;s soundscape embraces their primal metamorphosis from</P><P>confinement to glorious expansion. First, one big leaf-like headpiece appears, then the other, as the dancers couple and uncouple to create giant plants with their bodies in the pulsating deep green light. </P><P>                For blessed moments, we gratefully forget death and destruction in the desert, and drink in the cool lushness of our evolutionary journey from the dark wet mud to the sun - our toes as roots, our trunks strong and supple, our heads as verdant haloes in the dappled light. We remember.</P><P>                 Sara speaks about trying to embody life force in the dance medium and Lee tells us of working with the idea of the &quot;expanded moment&quot;. Both describe their collaboration method as the mutual fine crafting a strong idea. They say that remember? is very much a work in progress, and like the images of growth and change that it evokes, it is also continues to evolve.</P><P>                In her famous book, What is Art For?, Ellen Dissanayake tells us that all humans have a basic biological need for beauty in their lives. Although notions of beauty may be culturally determined, the urge to seek it and embrace it is very real. Anemone&#146;s remember? is a wonderful offering of the beauty we crave, now when we need it the most.</P></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="RIGHT">-at Dance Space Center</P><P ALIGN="RIGHT">New York, NY, May 3, 2003</P></FONT><FONT FACE="Times"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"></P></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="RIGHT">*published in New York Arts Magazine Vol.8 No.6 June 2003 [On-line], </P><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Available: </FONT><A HREF="http://nyartsmagazine.com/77/beauty.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">http://nyartsmagazine.com/77/beauty.htm</FONT></A></P><FONT FACE="Times"><P ALIGN="RIGHT"></P><P ALIGN="RIGHT">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P></FONT></BODY>

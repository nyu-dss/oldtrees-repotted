In the 20's schools started to plant forests to replace some of the trees.  Now of course, clear cutting of pine plantations does take place in a managed fashion with replanting always being a component and the forests of Wisconsin are  beautiful place again.Majestic characters like the MacArthur Pine are however a rare treat."<br>Jane Hansen<br>Chicago<p><center><img src="banjo.gif"><br><img src="wis1.gif"></center>&copy;  Jane Hansen 1998<br></h3><p><p>Latin Name:  Pinus Strobus<br>Common Name: White Pine<br>Location:  North of Crandon and Laona in the Nicolet National Forest, Wisconsin USA<br>Medium: Digital Photography</H3><p><p><p><p><p><p><hr><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<br><br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">  jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

I always wondered how beautifulit was, now I know. Here it is in .jpg, let me know ifthat is not the proper format. I own this work and itdates from roughly 1800. I've been researching it formonths and it may have been by John J. Audubon, Ifound the letters Aud on the lower left hand side.                                Andrew Zebrun III</pre></h4><p><p><p><center><img src="Niag.gif"></center><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

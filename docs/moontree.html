Our town has a moon tree, actually an American Elm, grownfrom a seed taken to the moon on Apollo 14.  Underneath it is atribute to the astronauts of the Challenger.  I hope to have myspecial ed students take a picture and write a report on it.  We'llsend it to you in September.  Good project!Diane LiebschAtchison Middle SchoolAtchison, KS</pre><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><center><A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">June Julian jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

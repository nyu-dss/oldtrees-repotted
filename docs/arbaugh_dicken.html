It may not be noted forbeing the biggest or the oldest, but this is a very special Maple. This treewas planted 18 years ago from a small sapling that was found in the woods onour property.  My Father and I planted this tree in the front yard of my newhome.  This Sugar Maple has survived a wind storm that took 10 feet off thetop, 3 years ago.  It was planted in clay soil in my front yard and I am amazedthat the poor thing is still growing.  My Father passed away 11 years ago andevery time I look at this tree it reminds me of him.  It is not 20 feet tallwith a 1 foot diameter.  With the care that this tree receives, it will bearound a long time.           <br>           -Roxanne Arbaugh-Dicken           </h3>           <pre>           </pre>           <h3>&copy; Roxanne Arbaugh-Dicken<br>           "Sugar Maple"<br>           Picture           </h3>           <h4> Common Name: Sugar Maple<br>           Latin Name: <i> Acer Saccharinum</i><br>           Circumference: 20 feet<br>           Location: Albany, OhioUSA</h4>           <pre></pre>           <A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>           Return to Main Page           <br><br><p><p><center><A           HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p>           <center>Please send e-mail to: June Julian<A           HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">           jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>           </HTML>

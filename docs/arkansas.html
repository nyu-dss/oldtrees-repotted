I would like some stories about trees in history,something along the line of Johnny Appleseed, etc.We have a tree here in Saline Co. that was carried to this locationin the coat pocket of a pioneer looking for a new home.  The tree is aTulip poplar. It is now some 105' tall with a limb span of 90' and a dbh of 6.8'  This tree came from Tennesse, and is said to be approx. 140 to 150 yrs. old.  It is the State Champion Tulip Poplar.Any stories like this you might have I would much like to read.Thank you for your time.forrest_bill@mail.snider.netSaline County RangerArkansas Forestry Commission</pre><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<br><br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">  jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

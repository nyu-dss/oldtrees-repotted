I am interested in the ahuehuetes of Mexico and the fact that several of them were considered sacred trees before the arrival of the Spaniard conquerors. This indeed is an issue that is of interest not only to Mexicans (because it is our national tree) but to all of humanity, therefore the Unesco, and the convention of the naturalendowment of Humanity. It seems to me that not only the Ahuehuete ofOaxaca is worthy of protection but the species of Ahuehuetes. I am awareof two sacred trees,one in Chalma the other, cut in half vertically andstill alive that creates a portal through which you have to go if youwant to climb to the piramid of El Tepozteco in Tepoztlan, Morelos. Thisahuehuete in Tepoztlan I think needs a diagnosis and protection. Could Ienlist your knowledge and cooperation on this? I'd like to investigatethe creation of an international group for the protection of allahuehuetes and very spaecifically the well known sacred ahuehuetes asthe ones in Oaxaca, Chalma and Tepoztlan. What do you think about this?Do you know others that I can talk to via e-mail, phone or mail? I am aMexican citizen and live in Cuernavaca Morelos. I speak Spanish, Englishand French.Diana Villaseqor</pre><p><p><hr><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

Or to ask if you have already painted it?Thanx for anything you might know...                                Sincerely,                                Jason M.

(An anti-creationist argument.)In my opinion, tree growth rings are the only source of reliable datingof the past, and it would dissapoint me if it was found that 6000 yearswas the upper limit of known tree ages. This would tend to supportbiblical creationist views, of which I am not a supporter.                Sincerely,                          Jeremy Williams                          Northern Territory                          Australia</pre><hr>From Eric:  <br><pre>Date: Sat, 18 Jan 1997 00:48:34 -0500 (EST)From: ZekeBnanza@aol.comTo: jj68@NYU.EDUSubject: Oldest trees  I thought the oldest known living organism and tree was a bristle conepine, named Methusala, in Inyo Nat'l Forest in California.  It has been datedat over 4000 years old.  If you know of any older, I would appreciate anyinformation you could provide me on it.Thanks,Eric</pre><hr><pre>Date: Fri, 30 Oct 1998 14:52:12 -0800From: Sandra Scott <sanscott@northnet.org>To: jj68@nyu.eduSubject: old treeIs this still a question... I thought the oldest known tree, stillliving, is the Dragon Tree on Tenerife... as least it is advertized assuch... what is the answer?ss</pre><hr><A HREF="huon.html">20,000 year old Huon Pine in Tasmania</A><hr><pre>Date: Fri, 12 Feb 1999 14:18:42 -0500From: Marcia Nelson & Mike Pedde <wolfnowl@idirect.com>To: Jerome Hutin Koechlin <jeromehutin@hotmail.com>> He plans to photograph the Huon pine in Tasmania, purported to be more> than 10,000 years oldFrom: http://www.delm.tas.gov.au/pluc/partb_35.html"The (Huon pine) species is generally dioecious, i.e. male and female cones areborne on separate plants, and is also known to reproduce vegetatively. Researchhas shown thatall the Huon Pine stems on Mt Read are sexually and genetically distinct. Allliving tissue is male in gender and consists of one genotype, suggesting thatthe Huon Pine stand consists of, or is derived from, one single individualplantwhich appears to have been present on the site for about 10 000 years. The onehectare patch of Huon Pine consists of a dense tangle of roots, stems andbranches which apparently have spread by a process of layering. The Mt Readstand is separated from the nearest population of Huon Pine by over 20kilometres of mountainous terrain and seedling dispersal is unlikely over suchdistances (Bacon and Peterson 1996). "     In other words, the plants that exist today come from a root base believed tobe 10,000 years old.  There are no 10,000 year old trees, however.From: http://www.tased.edu.au/tot/fauna/huon.html"Several examples of Huon Pine in southern Tasmania are believed to be over2,000 years old, making them one of the oldest living things in the world. TheHuon pine once existed in large numbers, but their unique qualities resulted inmany being felled. The felling of Huon pine is now restricted and reservesexist along the Denison River where the Huon pine may grow freely.

One, Jeremy's comments about"creationism." Really, neither of the ages he mentions upsets or supports"creationism." Some creationists place the start of things at 10,000 BC(figuring Adam at 4004 and the "six days of creation" before that to be 6000years ("a day is as a thousand years"). My view is that the Bible is speakingof the creation of the Garden of Eden at 4004, and the real beginning would correspond exactly with science's data. But that's beside my main point.There's a tree on Yakushima Island, Japan, said to be 7200 years ago, "bycarbon-14 dating." I've been trying to find out who did the dating, and how,to no avail. Any ideas on authenticating this, or is it just a gimmick to drawtourists? I can't see UNESCO supporting a fraud in their Heritage sites.Regards,B.

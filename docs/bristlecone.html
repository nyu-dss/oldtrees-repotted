I am a little sad that amoung yourcatagories of ancient trees you have left out the long-lived Great Basintree called the Bristlecone (Pinus longaeva).  This rare and ancientpinetree grows only in the high mountains of the isolated deserts ofCalifornia, Nevada, and Utah.  The Great Basin bristlecones are known asthe oldest trees in the world.  Methuselah Grove in the White Mountainsof California has some of oldest stands of these trees (4,000 yearsplus.)  In 1964, on Mount Washington in the Snake Range anover-enthusiastic researcher cut one of these ancient trees down.  Thetree's rings stopped at almost 5,000 years!        I have spent alot of time in the West Desert of Utah and whenever Ihave encountered these strange trees I have been in total awe of theirwild and primitive beauty.  More justice and recognition should be givento these endangered and ancient trees.  They are a priceless treasurethat belongs to all of us.  Without help, these trees may not be aroundfor future generations to view and experience.                                Clear blue skies,                                  David Jaussi</pre><h3> Please check out the art work done by students at <A HREF ="lowry.html">Albert Lowry High School</A> in Winnemucca, Nevada on this site.

I was attracted to the tree by its curly thick branches.  My tree is "treemendous"!<p>When I stand next to my tree, I feel like a tiny ant.  The tree is like a giant mushroom when I look up.  The tree has rough bark.  There are not a lot of skinny branches on my tree.  My tree is an oak tree that used to have two raccoons living in it.<p>The tree I picked is about 300 years old.  It is firmly planted in the ground. If I was a squirrel, the tree would be an apartment.

I graduatedoutof Montreal-just North of you :) And now i'm trying towork using the internet as a communication tool in the areaof Sustainable Development research, and promotion.It would be great to talk some more if you're interested?Tell me how the exhibit went and what projects you have onthe go now?Well anyway if i've caught your curiousity...maybe check outa website i designed and researched..and tell me what youthink:)It's: www.sustainability.com/planet/    and ya i know its noteasy to remember (i didnt choose it!!)See ya Jonathan Hanley :=>@</pre><p><pre><hr>Date: Sat, 26 Oct 1996 17:38:18 -0400 (EDT)From: EnviroNews Service <newsdesk@envirolink.org>To: environews@envirolink.orgSubject: E-Link: CLAYOQUOT BIOSPHERE RESERVE ENDORSEDCLAYOQUOT BIOSPHERE RESERVE ENDORSEDMONTREAL, October 24 (ENS) - A possible solution is in sight to the volatileClayoquot Sound dispute over clearcut logging in one of the last remainingancient temperate rainforest valleys of British Columbia. In this valley onthe west coast of Vancouver Island, wild salmon streams run into the PacificOcean and forest giants offer homes for endangered marbled murrelets,land-nesting sea birds.Just before wrapping up their triennial conference Wednesday, members of theIUCN (World Conservation Union) unanimously endorsed a resolution supportingdesignation of Clayoquot Sound as an internationally recognized BiosphereReserve. The move brings environmentalists one step closer in a 12 yearcampaign to end clearcutting in the 2,620 kilometer area (1,011 square miles).The battle over the Clayoquot has included blockades leading to the arrestsof over 900 citizens, international market campaigns, massive publiceducation campaigns, the construction of a boardwalked trail into the areaand vandalism to that boardwalk, and a demonstration a few months ago in SanFrancisco that tied up morning rush hour traffic for hours.Passage of the IUCN resolution is the result of a coordinated effort by theWestern Canada Wilderness Committee (WCWC), the Sierra Club of BritishColumbia, Greenpeace Canada, and the Washington, DC-based Natural ResourcesDefense Council, one of the environment groups that forwarded the originalresolution to the IUCN's Montreal Congress. The provincial government ofBritish Columbia voted in favor of the resolution."We are delighted that the B.C. government, as a new IUCN member, supportedthis resolution," said Adriane Carr, Clayoquot Campaign Coordinator for theWCWC. "Government support is bound to make this process easier."The resolution noted that the process for planning this reserve shouldinvolve all stakeholders including the Nu-chah-nulth Central Region Tribes,federal and provincial governments, Clayoquot Central Region Board, localcommunities and environment groups. It further urged that the processconsider the importance of increased protection of pristine areas as coreareas for protecting biodiversity as well as create new opportunities forsustainable community development.Biosphere Reserve designation is international recognition of a land useplan and a land use process that is locally driven, explains Carr. "It hassome "absolute ground-rules. The biodiversity in the area has to beprotected through a core preservation cell. Second, this has to be an areathat is a model in terms of sustainable development. A biosphere reserve isnot like a park. It's a place where people live, where people work, whereresources are in fact utilitzed in an ecologically sustainable way. Thethird component is that it has to have local decision-making through locally"A biosphere is really an evolving kind of notion. Nothing is static becauseour earth and the actions of humans aren't static. It will evolve, but thereis a vision and a plan around that evolution. That is what gets acknowledgedby the United Nations Man and Biosphere Committee."The biosphere reserve proposal must be endorsed by all stakeholders andsubmitted to Canada's Man and Biosphere Committee by the end of February ifit is to be considered by the international committee at its 1997 meeting inearly May.---The EnviroNews Service              | E-Mail: newsdesk@envirolink.orgA Project of the EnviroLink Network | Phone : (412) 683-6400General Info: info@envirolink.org   | Fax   : (412) 683-8460</pre><p><p><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

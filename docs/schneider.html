Schneider</h1></center><p><p><h3><center>Artist's Statement</center><br><br>These trees are from a tiny piece of untouched land in the place I grew up in.(Lawrence, Long Island, NY).  It was here that I first felt the pulse.<br><br>Before then, I felt Nature, Earth, even myself as dead.  But having the opportunity toreturn home and spend some quiet time with my place of origin I realized that this Earthand its beings are ALIVE and that I am ALIVE.<br><br>I can feel the tree energy.  We live together in harmony.  We communicate.<br>Breath/Connection<br><br.As I was growing up, I had found peace in the trees that surrounded my home.<br><br>This work is about the connection with my Nature.  I want my Nature to be liberated from my past's conventions, to breathe, to be grounded.  I thank these trees for sharingthis sacred message with me.<br><p><center><img src=schneider1.gif></center><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><h3>&copy;  Nancy J.

Igrew up on Woodmere Blvd and graduated Lawrence HS in the fabulous year1969. Growing up there, I remember seeking out 'untouched' locations onmy bike. In fact I remember specifically that behind that Hewlett schoolon Peninsula Blvd. there was a creek that went back into some woods. Itseemed enormous back then, most probably it was just an odd lot. But, itcultivated in me a continuing desire to be a part of the woods andnatural world. My friends and I would always travel there and wanderaround. Back behind Old Lawrence was another favorite destination. Evenin Woodmere Park, we used to pretend that the carefully planted shrubswere an extension of the woods, and we would become woodland creatures(though I am sure the neighbors did not appreciate our mucking aboutthrough their plantings). There was also a Nature Center of some sortout there in Lawrence....can't call up the name of it right now. Is thatwhere your photos were shot? One last remininiscence: I had anunforgettable fifth grade teacher at PS 6. Her name was Mrs. Sulzbacher.She was like the gypsy queen. Full of large hoop earings, always tanned,circle skirts, and a love of nature that seeded in me. Thanks Nancy forthis time to recollect, and the inspiring imagery.Terry (now a fifth grade teacher, living in Mt.Kisco, NY)alter@cloud9.net</pre><br><br><br><br><br><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<br><br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">  jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

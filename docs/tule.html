One of these trees, known as ElArbol del Tule, is worlwide admired for its longevity and huge dimensions:it is more than 2000 years old and has a circumference of about 54 meters. The Tule tree is a unique natural monument and the area in which it lives isalso of great natural value. Since the 1940's this area has changedconsiderably. Lack of subterranean water and urbanization, among otherfactors, are seriously compromising the future of these monumental trees. Inorder to address this situation the organization Mi Amigo el Arbol wasformed in 1994.The diagnosisThe organization, with support from governmental and scientific agencies,obtained a preliminary scientific diagnosis of the Tule Tree. This diagnosisshows that the tree is, at present,  capable of supporting a whole range ofplants and animals including several pathogens that live on it. However, thediagnosis also shows that radical changes in the enviroment, particularlyfurther reduction of the water tables or reduction of natural surroundinghabitat might threaten its existence. At present during the dry season, thewater table was found to decrease by more than 6 meters, which is a ratherlarge decrease given to the high demand of water supply of this tree species.Therefore, the moment for protecting the tree is now. To delay giving it thenecessary support and care could create an irreversibly decline in itshealth that could result is its dead. This would be a terrible end to such amagnificent tree which is in itself an indicator of the overall status ofthe land around it. Its loss would be a shame for this generation ofOaxacans for not acting on time to solve this problem.The taskBesides improving the Tule Tree life condition as well as the other trees,an integral solution to the problem will be possible if and only if twomicroriver basins  are restored to insure sufficient recharge of groundwater supplies. This means that immediate measures must be taken to insurethat these microbasins do not continue to deteriorate further both inenvironmental and ecological aspects.To address this need, the organization Mi Amigo el Arbol has proposed thatthe state government declare the zone where the microbasins are located as aprotected area.It is important to mention that near to this critical zone (where the sourceof Oaxaca's water resources is located) is host to several industries andthat it has been decclared as the major industrial zone of the state,according to the state zoning ordinance. Thus, the government protection bymeans of a legal decree is necessary to restore the microbasins and tofacilitate vigorous actions to defend our natural resources and naturaltreasures.Since the Tule tree is located near the city of Oaxaca, the habitat in whichit lives has a definite influence on the microclimate of the city. The useof the surrounding area's soil has traditionally been for agriculture andforestry besides being a most important tourist route. For this reason ourorganization proposes the celebration of an agreement of conditions with thefederal, state and municipal governments to carry out programs ofsustainable development and programs of resource managenment involvingpeople living in the microriver basins.Finally, taking into account the invaluable richness of the Tule tree andthe other ahuehuetes for which we Mexicans are so proud (the ahuehuete isour National Tree), we propose to the federal and state governments torequest that the Convention of the Natural Endowment for the Humanity andUNESCO to designate the Arbol del Tule  and its associated microbasins ashaving maximum universal value, so that the interest in preserving andimproving the regions be on behalf of the people of the World. This in turnwill promote the Tule tree as a tourist attraction of the highest level andwill encourage the economic reactivation and sustainable development in thestate of Oaxaca.Ing.

It measures 20 feet in circumference and has a diameter of 7 feet. It isgrowing in the side yard of my family's property in Bucyrus, Ohio.  It is thebiggest tree I have ever seen and it is the largest in our surrounding area.One fact that I learned last evening from a local historian was that the firstowners of our home had a very interesting ritual with the tree.  When I afamily member died, they took the blood from their body and poured it aroundthe base of the tree.  Now if this is true I don’t know, but I thought it wasan interesting piece of local folklore.  I hope you all like this tree as muchas I do.  I have grown up around and played in and have some great personalmemories of my own. <br>-Kirsten Zahn</h3><pre></pre><h3>&copy; Kirsten Zahn<br>"Bucyrus' Largest Tree"<br>Computer Graphics</h3><h4> Common Name: English Oak<br>Latin Name: <i> Quercus Robur</i><br>Circumference: 13 feet<br>Location: Bucyrus, Ohio USA</h4><pre></pre><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A> Return to MainPage<br><br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to: June Julian<AHREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A></HTML>

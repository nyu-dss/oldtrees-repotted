There are two of these trees in my yard by the garden. They create a great place to hang a hammock andjust get comfortable, hence the name, comfort tree. I can't think of anything more reminiscent of comfort than laying in a hammock on a warmsummer eve and watching the sun set. I hope that you too can enjoy my 'comfort' tree. Better yet, I hope you can find one of your own." <br> -David Shaw-</h3> <pre> </pre> <h3>&copy; David Shaw<br> "Comfort Tree "<br> Computer Graphics </h3> <h4> Common Name: Northern Catalpa <br> Latin Name: <i> Catalpa speciosa</i><br> Circumference: 45 inches<br> Location: Chandlersville, Ohio USA</h4> <pre> </pre> <A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A> Return to Main Page <br><br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p> <center>Please send e-mail to: June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A> </HTML>

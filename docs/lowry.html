Unfortunately, after speaking with my studentsonly three of them had visited the Great Basin National Park and had actually seen these ancient trees."<br>     "However, I saw this as an opportunity to introduce them to these wonderful, natural sculptures.  The USFS sent slides and an assortment of materials.  I brought in books from the public library on this subject.  Consequently, I have fifty students who are better informed about the state they live in and one of the world's oldest living trees."<br>     "This project has opened up the world of computers to me.  I've run into many obstaclesand by so doing I have learned a great deal about the computer needs for my classroom, our school and community.  Our local newspaper is doing an article about our involvement with this project and the problems my students and I are facing."<br></h3><h2>Student Artists from  Albert Lowry High School, Winnemucca, Nevada:<br></h2><br><h3>(Please click on their names to see their tree art and to read their writings)<h3><ul><li><A HREF="susan.html">Susan</A><br><li><A HREF="dakota.html">Dakota</A><br><li><A HREF="willie.html">Willie</A><br><li><A HREF="nicole.html">Nicole</A><br><li><A HREF="amy.html">Amy</A><br><li><A HREF="gloria.html">Gloria</A><br><li><A HREF="jared.html">Jared</A><br><li><A HREF="megan.html">Megan</A><br><li><A HREF="manny.html">Manny</A><br><li><A HREF="tanya.html">Tanya</A><br><li><A HREF="daniel.html">Daniel</A><br><li><A HREF="calli.html">Calli</A><br></h3></ul> <p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<br><br><center><A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">June Julian  jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

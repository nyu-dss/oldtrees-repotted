<TITLE>Glen Rice</TITLE><center><h1>Glen Rice</h1></center><pre>Here's a photograph I made of my favorite tree.This is a Bur Oak, the Missouri State Champion Bur Oak, in fact.It is 84 feet tall with a spread of 116 feet. It has a circumference of 272inches at 54" above the ground.The big tree is located on the Williamson farm, about a mile from McBaine,Missouri, in the Missouri River floodplain. There are no other trees near it.                        It's about 350 years old. There were some fears locally that it would notsurvive the Great Flood of 1993, but despite standing in six feet of water forawhile, the tree survived without problems. (I can send you a gif of the treeunderwater, or you can see it at <A HREF="http://www.wmwoods.edu/glen/images/TREE2.GIF">http://www.wmwoods.edu/glen/images/TREE2.GIF</A>,if you're interested.)The big tree has been a favorite local destination for generations. It's agreat spot for picnics, or just to visit. It's also very photogenic, surrounded byopen fields. I try to visit the big tree every few months. I've often thoughtof climbing it, but that would require bringing out ropes or a ladder, which wouldreally be cheating. Besides, the big tree is too big to be climbed by merehumans.Regards,Glenn P.

Students are learning about the importance of their local environment and issues of biodiversity and old growth forests as a springboard for creating art together. These art works done by students in year 8 are based on an old Ironbox tree from our nearby Killawarra Forest. The box Ironbark Forests are endangered and there are not many old trees in the forests due to forest practices in the past. This tree is about 300-500 years old and it is probably the oldest in this forest.<p>- Jim Samon<br>Arts Convenor<br>Galen College<br> Wangaratta, Victoria, Australia</h3><center><p><p><p><p><p><p><img src="galen4.jpg"><p><p><p><img src="galen3.jpg"><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p></center><hr><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<p><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><br><br><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">  jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

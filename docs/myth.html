Its shadow at dawn and sunset is said to have cast ashadow for hundeds of miles.  Hundreds of thousands of people could walk onit when it fell.  One of its stems was like a long hill range.The Kurita Tree was a Chestnut in the province of Omi, also in Japan.Its branches spread so far that the nuts fell scores of miles away, one nutforms a mound in Ise.  The trees shadow covered many districts.  People tothe northwest, in Wakasa, said their rice crop failed because of the shadowand petitioned the Emperor to cut it down.  Supposedly he did so.The Katsura Tree is naturalized in Japan but suspected of being Chinese inorigin.  It was a kind of laurel said to live on the moon and be visible inits dark spots.  In those olden times other cultures too had stories oftrees that filled the entire universe.                                     Keep on,                                       Mark Healy                                            Pacific Grove, Ca.                                               Home to many amazing trees.</pre></h4><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

Because the specific theme of this ecology art research project is old trees, in this introduction I will present a short overview of the tree paintings that were the studio impetus for this study.  After that, I will give a brief background of the student ecology work that led up to the current ecology art project on the World Wide Web, "A World Community of Old Trees."<br>(to be continued...)</h3><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><br><br><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian <A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

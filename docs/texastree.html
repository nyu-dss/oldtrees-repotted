I teach German at Friendswood Jr. High,located just oustide of Houston. I read about your tree project on St.Olaf's project page.        What a wonderful idea!  I hope your project turns outbeautifully!  I think it will, in fact!        Anyway, we have an excellent tree candidate for your project.  It islocated in the courtyard between our academic buildings.  It is a veryold, special tree, and I stop students often just to talk to them aboutthis tree and make them notice it.  So when I read about your treeproject, I stopped everything to write you this message.        Let me give you some history.  Friendswood just celebrated itscentennial last year.  We are a Quaker-founded community.   At one time,there was a one-room school house where our jr. high is now, right nextto The Tree.  The Tree itself is about 200 years old.  I make thestudents realize that everyone who has ever gone through Friendswoodschools has seen The Tree, and The Tree has seen them.  Even the peoplethat are now planted out in the Friendswood Chruch cemetery have seen TheTree.        The Tree itself is a huge, beautiful oak tree.  The trunk isround and straight.  The canopy is wide and symetrical; it looks like anumbrella!  There are no bald spots, and no big main branches.  It spreadsout very evenly, and looks great from all angles!  If someone says to me,"Tree," my first thought is of The Tree in the courtyard of FriendswoodJr. High School.  It is as close to an ideal tree as there is.        OK, enough about that.  Can you tell I love this tree?  :)  I amgoing to give you the e-mail address of the art teacher at our school.Her name is Theresa Goodwin, and I am sure that she would love toparticipate in your project.  She could get the kids to draw/paintpictures of The Tree, or anything that you need.  Write to:        ther@tenet.eduOur school phone number is (713) 482-7818.Good luck!  I hope to hear from you soon!                                Sincerely,                                        J P Mayer</pre><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><center><A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">June Julian jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

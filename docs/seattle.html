The largest tree in King County, Washington, where Seattle islocated, WAS a Douglas Fir. It was 255 feet tall,26.5 feet incircumference and 575 years old. It blew down about five  years ago.It wasmagnificent. It now lies rotting in O.O. Denny Park on the East side ofLake Washington. We are fighting hard to save the old growth habitat inthe Northwest. When there are only a few left, like with this giantspecimen, they crash with a puff of wind. PLEASE CONTACT PRESIDENT CLINTONAND ASK HIM TO SAVE OLD GROWTH FOREST. Why is he allowing destruction ofthis precious, unique and irreplacable ecosystem? Congress passed the"salvage rider" without due consideration. Clinton can hold up the cuttingby administrative decree until the whole issue is debated. Please ask himto do that.Thank you for caring.

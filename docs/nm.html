Some years ago, on my travels in the high country ofsouthern New Mexico I discovered two relict trees of Taxodium mucronatumgrowing uncultivated.There is a third tree growing in the lower valley near Las Cruces that is ofunknown orgin and may be over 400 years old.  I have collected seed from allthree trees and grown them out into young trees which are proving to be morecold hardy then their Mexican relatives.  One plant has survived outplantingin central Illinois at a zone 5 site  for two winters and minus 25 degrees F. Progeny of the Mexican trees that I've propagated at my Arboretum Tomelocation have not been hardy at temperatures below plus 5 degrees F.Best Regards,  Michael Martin Melendrez</pre></h4><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

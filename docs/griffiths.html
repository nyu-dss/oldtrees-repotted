Something that rendersme unlike the other graduate students who come to Athens, Ohio each year tostudy at Ohio University.  I was born here.   I haven't lived my whole lifehere.  By the time I came back to graduate school, I had been gone for 15years and had lived in four other places.  Upon my return, being curiousabout what 15 years had done to my old home, naturally that was one of myfirst stops.  It was in great disrepair, but this being the case, nothingmuch had changed, only fallen into moderate decay.   It looked smaller thanI remembered, of course--all except one thing.  Outside the house on TerraceDrive, there stands an apple tree.  When I was little, my sister and Icalled it "The Caterpillar Tree"  because it was always so covered with thefurry insects that it almost seemed to be made of them.  This tree was theone thing at my old inhabitance that appeared exactly as I remembered it,which got me thinking.  It must have been growing along with me all theseyears--sort of an ecological counterpart.  And while it may not be of greatimportance in size or grandeur, the caterpillar tree means something to me.It means you can always count on the environment around you to not onlyspark memories, but to ground you in a deeper understanding of where youcame from."        <br>        -Megan Griffiths        </h3>        <pre>        </pre>        <h3>&copy; Megan Griffiths<br>        "The Caterpillar Trees"<br>        point(&click)alism--Photoshop drawing        </h3>        <h4> Common Name: Common Apple<br> Latin Name: <i> Malus Sylvestris</i><br>        Circumference: 3 feet<br>        Location: Athens, Ohio USA</h4>        <pre>        </pre>        <A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A> Returnto Main Page        <br><br><p><p><center><AHREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p>        <center>Please send e-mail to: June Julian<AHREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">        jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>        </HTML>

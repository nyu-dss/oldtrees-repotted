I have another more recentpicture of the Hanging Tree and once I scan it I will forward it to yoursite to accompany this one.  It has long since died, been torched, andhad a chainsaw taken to it to "prune" it (why anybody would prune a deadtree . . . ), so its modern appearance is quite different.  According tofolk history, at least 12 men (mostly natives) were hung from the treeduring the mid to late 19th Century, and some of the bodies were thrownfolk history, at least 12 men (mostly natives) were hung from the treeduring the mid to late 19th Century, and some of the bodies were thrownin nearby rock pits that are the tailings of Chinese-operated placergold mining operations.Mike ClevenComputer Systems ManagerWay of Life SchoolShalalth BC</pre><center><h1>Giants of Burrard Inlet & English Bay/False Creek, Vancouver BC</H1></center><pre>FYI, another interesting item concerns the trees of Burrard Inlet andEnglish Bay/False Creek in Vancouver.  There are no extant pictures of thethousands of giants that were felled there, but when logging began in the1860s the site of modern-day Vancouver was home to the largest trees thathave ever existed, averaging well above 16 feet in diameter and mostcresting well above 300 feet; the highest in BC today was recently found inthe city's Coquitlam watershed, and is a spruce some 320 feet high.  Some ofthe trees cut in what is today the city's Jericho neighbourhood were in thevicinity of 400 feet.It has been stated that the construction of the windjammer fleets of theAmerican merchant marine and the British Navy in the latter days of the Ageof Sail would have been impossible without the mast-spars that were cut inBurrard Inlet and English Bay.  I cannot remember the exact dimensions, butsomething like several dozen 140 foot beams of clear spruce (or fir?),measuring 8 feet by 12 feet and clear-grained for their entire length, weresold to the Emperor of China by the Jeremiah Rogers logging company from theJericho ("Jerry's Cove") area in the 1870s, and today comprise the raftersof one of the great halls in the Forbidden City.  This can be verified byconsulting the city's historical archive.The only pictures I can think of that concern this grove of vanished giantsare of the "Princess Louise Tree", which stood near the old Hastings Sawmillat the eastern end of Gastown (the old part of Vancouver) and which isvisible in many "skyline" photos taken from the harbour.  There are alsosome of oxen teams dragging the felled giants across skid roads through theconiferous swamps that the city has been superimposed upon over the courseof the last century.  One famous picture, showing people standing about afir that was supposed to have stood and been fallen at the modern corner ofGeorgia and Granville Streets (the equivalent of 34th and Broadway inManhattan) is now believed to be a trick-photography hoax.  There are manyother archival pictures, however, of loggers and others standing amid thevanished groves of giant evergreens.  The tiny areas of forest that havebeen just barely protected - Cathedral Grove on the Tofino Highway, CarmanahValley, and so on - are bare shadows of the immensity of British Columbia'sformer arborea, and it is conceded by forestry historians that the site ofpresent-day Vancouver was unchallenged in size and majesty throughout thelength of the coast and islands of the Pacific Northwest.  This is, nodoubt, why it was the first area of the province to be thoroughly clear-cut.I am nowhere near the city archives or library at present, and their imagesare not yet on-line, although you may enquire directly to them concerningreproduction; the provincial archive's web address should cross-referenceyou to the other archives and libraries hereabouts.Mike Cleven</pre><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><center><A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">June Julian jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

Craziness going on here.  <br>Our ice went out then school closed for the summer.  Early ice-out this year.<br>Such is life in the woods.<br>Oldest tree in our neighborhood...well, that's hard to say...<br><br>Since we live in the woods and the woods are our neighborhood, ah, people don't <br>generally keep track of them around here.  I suppose we should.  You know, I'm just<br>making a guess.  In fact, my family and I were out in the boat yesterday and I looked<br>around to what I think MIGHT be an older growth of trees in the area.  I think that<br>the oldest growth of trees in downriver from us about 6 miles.<br><br> We have short needled spruce trees, lots of willows, cotton woods, tamars and <br>birch.  In our area the spruce trees don't grow very tall because we are in a valley<br>sort of.  Lots of permafrost here, too.  Tall, TALL spruce trees grow on the Yukon River <br>hills about 39 miles from here.  They get a girth of about 5' in diameter.  I think.<br>Sorry, got no pictures to send you!  Take care.  Hope this helps<br>Have a great summer<br><br>Joy<br>Innoko River School</h3><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><center>Please send e-mail to: June Julian <A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

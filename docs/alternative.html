We are collecting earthfrom all fifty states that could be mixed together and placed at the rootsof each of the four corner trees.  Bill Clinton sent me earth from the WhiteHouse lawn.</pre><p><hr><A HREF="elder.html">Celia Freese</A><p><hr><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p></h3><hr><A HREF="trees.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<br><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">     jj68@nyu.edu</A></center>

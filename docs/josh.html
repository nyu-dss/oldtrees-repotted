From there, it was off to the photocopier where I turned and flipped the transparencies.  From there, I reassembled the photocopies into their final form and added the colored lines in marker.     I've made several discoveries while doing this project.  The first is that even though I've lived in Flemington, New Jersey for most of my life, this is the first time that I actually saw my tree  (it's on Main Street).  About 100 yards behind my tree is a newly built prison on land that used to be a playground.  Furthermore, I have definitely anthropomorphized my tree, seeing several distinct faces and human body elements in its bark and limbs."</h3><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><h3>&copy Josh 1996 <br>Grade 12<br>  Gill St. Bernard's School<br>Gladstone, New Jersey  USA<br><p>Tree Chaos Series<br>Xerox and Marker on Paper  8 "X14"</h3><h4>Beech<br><i>Latin Name: TBA</i><br>Age:  Unknown<br>Circumference: TBA</h4><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><hr><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian, jj68@nyu.edu</center><p><p><p><p><center>A World Community of Old Trees<br>&copy; 1996 - 2004  June Julian<br>All rights reserved.</center><p>

It continues to serve as an open digital space to receive the input of hundreds of tree enthusiasts from all over the world.     To date, the three major sections of the project,  TREE GALLERY, TREE MUSEUM,  and TREE TALK, include well over 100 separate Web pages with contributions of text, imagery, and digital multimedia from persons of all ages, from 21 states and 18 countries.     My research objective was to examine the potential of the World Wide Web as a medium of communication and exchange for ecology art education.  In the following links, I have included excerpts from the <A HREF="intro.html"> Introduction</A> and <A HREF="conclusion.html">Conclusion</A> chapters of my dissertation.</h3><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><hr><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><br><br><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian <A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0"><center><h1>Trees from China, the Silk Road, and Tibet</h1></center><h3>In June of this summer, I had the opportunity to visit the cities of Beijing, Chengdu, Lhasa, Xian, Dunhuang, Turpan and Urumqi.  Please keep watching this page for photos of the extraordinary trees that I encountered during my travels in China and Tibet.<p><p><center><img src="gobi.gif"><p><p><p><i>Guan Yin Lin</i><br>The Bodhisattva Tree at Mingsha Mountain in the Gobi Desert near Dunhuang<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Old Cypress at the Emporer's Summer Palace, Beijing, China:<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><img src="sp_beijing.gif"><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p></center>Note:From what I could understand, the small metal tags on the trees mean that they are part of a government list and that the various colors signify the age of the tree.  Also, it seems that the significance of the tag colors varies from province to province. If anyone has futher information about this system, could you please send e-mail to me at the address below?<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p></h3><hr><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align =left></A>     Return to Main Page<br><br><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><P><P><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

Document your tree with any medium you like: photography, drawing, painting, or computer graphics, etc. <br><p>3. Identify the tree with its common and Latin name and provide some descriptive text about the tree, giving your personal reaction, the  exact location, approximate age, and any local history you can gather, and the tree's circumference, 54" from the ground. Please remember to label your artwork with title, medium, and size. You can look in the  <A HREF="toc.html">Table of Contents</A> for artist examples.<br><p>4. Send your electronic file to me (.gif or .jpg files not to exceed 100 K) as an e-mail attachment<br><p>5. Or express your experience with your special tree in your own way!<br> Pre-approved alternate interpretations of these suggestions are welcome.<p><p></h3><p><p><p><br><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left>Return to Main Page</A><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian<A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">  jj68@nyu.edu</A HREF></h3><br><h5>All contents copyright <br>&copy; 1996-2003 June Julian<br>All rights reserved<p><i>A World Community of Old Trees</i>  is an Art Education Research Project sponsored by New York University<br><i>My Great Trees!

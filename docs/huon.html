We have one particular tree down here I'm sure youwould be interested in. It's just been found and it is at least 20,000years old- and still alive! it's a Huon Pine- indigenous to Tasmania- wherewe live- and the tree actually keeps regenerating so that it looks like asmall forest but is actually one organism. Has people from all over theworld fascinated of course- and it has been fenced off so no-one can getanywhere near it thank goodness. It is actually on a mining lease here - sothank goodness the owners of the lease demonstrated a conscience with this!I think I may be able to get photos- I'm not sure- but would have to mailor fax them to you-so can you send an address and I'll see what I can do.Most of the rest of our trees are around 3-400 years old- that's themaximum age for most as the pines and gums down here are not known fortheir longevity.   I'll have a talk to Parks and Wildlife for you when Iget a chance. They may have something we can send.Best of luck. What a wonderful way of preserving these old beauties- toimmortalize them in cyberspace!Kind regardsJulie Boyd</pre><p><p><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><center><A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">June Julian jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

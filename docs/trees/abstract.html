Ecker <br>  &quot;A World Community of Old Trees&quot; is an ecology art project on the   World Wide Web with open participation and a special section for students in   grades K-12 and their art teachers. The purpose of this on-line study is to   examine the potential of the Web as a medium for communication and exchange   for ecology art education.<br>  As aesthetic inquiry, this research is a metacritique of past ecology art projects   on the Internet. Earlier projects used e-mail for instructions and promotion,   and exchanged student art work at the conclusion via regular mail. Using David   Ecker&#146;s Matrix of Generic Questions for Curriculum Research as the navigational   tool for on-line research, &quot; A World Community of Old Trees&quot; responds   to his third question, &quot;What could be the case?&quot; The new project develops   former on-line projects on six points: participation, interaction, content,   promotion, information collection and distribution, and evaluation. It engages   a global community of learners in identifying, writing about, and documenting   with visual images, the oldest trees in their environment. <br>  Philosophical bases for this process are the biocentric ecology of Aldo Leopold   and the environmental aesthetics of Arnold Berleant, both of which employ vivid   description and deep personal relationships with nature.<br>  The research project has three main components. Participants can contribute   to the Tree Gallery, containing tree imagery in a variety of media with accompanying   text, to the Tree Museum, with Web Sources and Print Sources, and to Tree Talk,   containing information on tree ecology, a Fill-out Survey Form and a Comment   Form, and an E-mail Archive. <br>  Evaluation of the project is based on six objectives: potential, interaction,   cross-cultural participation, community, ecology, and openness. Recommendations   to art teachers as to &quot;What should be the case?&quot; are based on William   E. Doll&#146;s post-modern perspective on curriculum development where each   teacher is both a creator and an implementor of curriculum.   </pre>  </p></body>

Information I found is that this tree is over 10 years old, and that it was there 9 years ago when my friends moved in.  They wonder if it will grow any more.<p>Under the Birch tree I feel small and short even though it's not that tall.  It's only over 7 feet tall.  <p>The tree is located in the front of my friends' house.  The Birch tree has white bark with little cuts in it.  Birch trees may have toad stools around them so watch out they're poisonous.  Birch trees may live to be 300 years or older.  The bark of the Birch tree is smooth and rough.  The bark comes off into sheets.  The leaves are sort of small and rough.  There's some fuzzy things that looks like a stamon but is not.  This comes down with the leaves. <br><center>-Heather</center></h3><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><h3>c.Heather<br>Grade 4<br>  Thomas Jefferson Magnet School<br>Euclid, Ohio  USA<br><p>"Birch Tree"<br>pencil, crayons, and collage on paper    9"X12"  </h3><h4>Birch<br><i>Latin Name: TBA</i><br>Age:  70 years old<br>Circumference at 54 inches from the base: TBA <br>Location: Euclid, Ohio  USA</h4><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<br><br><center><A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">June Julian  jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

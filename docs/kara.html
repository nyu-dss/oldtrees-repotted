My tree is in my grandparents' backyard and it was there when they moved in 35 years ago.  It is roughly 50 years old.  I feel excited next to my tree because I like climbing its branches and I feel unique, like one of a kind, because my tree always looks different, so do I.  The tree always comforts me and welcomes me into its branches.<p>I always used my tree even when I was a baby my swing was on its branches.  Even my Mom used it when she was little.  She made forts up in the tree.  My grandma used the apples for apple strudel.  In the next yard there is an apple tree too.  Across the street in the yards there are some plum and pear trees, so I think this area was an orchard before the houses were built.<br><center>-Kara</center><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><h3>c.

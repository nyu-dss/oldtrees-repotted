MullaneCourier TimesTuesday April 30, 1996The 514- year-old oak tree in Frank and Josephine Leuzzi's back yard hasThe 514- year-old oak tree in Frank and Josephine Leuzzi's back yard hassurvived harsh winters, blistering summers, even the crack of musket shot fromthe American Revolution."People stop to look at it seven days a week, all year long," said JosephineLeuzzi. "I've seen people praying under it."These days, the tree could use some prayer.The White oak, in poor health for years, was dealt a life-threatening blow lastAugust 7 when a thunder storm ripped away a a main limb. In an instant, onethird of the tree was on the ground."When I saw it, I was just sick," said Leuzzi.Even the mighty oak, determined by borings to be probably the oldest tree ontheEast Coast, can't withstand the ravages of age forever, said Bill Truscott, antheEast Coast, can't withstand the ravages of age forever, said Bill Truscott, anarborist whose firm, Bartlett Trees, is nursing the tree."It's a very aged patient that is slowly declining. We can't stop the decline.All we can do is slow it down," he said.Special fertilizers have been spread. Cables keep its thick, gnarled branchesfrom crashing to the ground. This season, the soil will be inoculated to helpthe tree's roots absorb more water and nutrients."We're dealing with a very mature tree, and mature trees are always in a stateof decline," Truscott said.After last summer's storm, Josephine Leuzzi put an ad in a local weeklynewspaper seeking help.  Donations poured in --enough for the couple to hireBartlett Trees and put a split rail fence around the oak to keep the curiousfrom getting clobbered by a loose limb.The tree was nearly 200 years old when John Pidcock, said to be the firstEuropean settler in Bucks County, moved here in the 1640's. The tree's 300thbirthday was approaching when Washington slogged across the Delaware nearby in1776.Ronald Reagan kept a piece of the tree in the oval office. A cross made fromitsbranches marks the grave of renowned Bucks County woodworker and artist GeorgeNakashima.It's sacred to the Lenape Indians, who inhabited the hills along the DelawareRiver here and are believed to have planted it. After last year's storm,severalsurviving Lenapes prayed beneath it for its survival, said Josephine Leuzzi.And it's special to at least 10 couples who've been married beneath it sincetheAnd it's special to at least 10 couples who've been married beneath it sincetheLeuzzi moved here from South Philadelphia 21 years ago."God gave us this tree," Leuzzi said. "It breathes. It gives beauty. It givesshelter. It gives us shade. Your should see it when it has leaves. Gorgeous."Last winter's record-breaking snowfalls may have made the tree pretty, but theyalso were alarming, she said."I really worried that it wouldn't survive the snow," she said, looking up atthe enormous branches.------------------------------------------------The photo is a great distant view of the Tree and the surrounding countryside.I hope you don't have too much trouble getting it.If you'd like me to help again.........let me know......I'll be visiting yourpage to see what's new.If you have time, check out my page..http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/GIsenberggood luckGinette</pre><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><center><A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">June Julian jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

Project participants from first graders to senior citizens, representing 17 states and 8 countries, have sent in their images, stories and facts about the most extraordinary trees in their world. 	This study was initiated with the objective of examining the potential of the World Wide Web as a medium for  communication and exchange for an ecology art project.  How naive to think that I could assess the potential of an entity so vast and so synergistic!  I may as well have set out to examine the potential of the human spirit itself, for that, of course, is what propels the Web.  With regard to the Web's potential as applied to this ecology art project, I was able to make some observations, and I will share them here. <br>(to be continued...)</h3><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>   Return to Main Page<p><p><center><A HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><br><br><center>Please send e-mail to:  June Julian <A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

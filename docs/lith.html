We are Lithuanian and we live in the towncalled Silute. We are the students of the highschool No.4, grade 5 (11 - 12 years old). With greateagerness we join in the project concerning largetrees.   Outside our town there is a large oak. It is the tallest oak in our area and it is called Pagryniu oak. The name is derived from the village calledPagryniai. Its length is  0.5 meter and its heightis 24 meters. In 1960's the oak was registered intothe list of to be protected in our area. In 1980's,the oak was registered as nature monument of therepublic of Lithuania.   The other information and decription of the oakwill follow later.            Sincerely,            your Lithuanian friends.<HR><center><img src="lith.gif"></center>Participants in the project, <br> pupils of form 5 (11-12 years old) and their teacher, Regina Jasudiene</pre><p><h3>Read about the Legend of the Oak, sent in by two of Regina's students.</h3><br><pre>The Legend about the oakThe old inhabitants of Silute's town tell that before the town wasfounded, a little village was there. In that village, there wasa little cabin with its two masters: a father and his daughter. Thefather planted an oak when his daughter was born. Once a band of robbers besieged the village. Everyone was killed.The robbers came to the cabin also. They killed the father andwere about to kill the daughter. She, though, grabbed a rock andpierced herself. So she lay dead at the roots of the oak.   The time passed, and the oak grew into a huge tree. The cabinhowever, was destroyed by time.  In the evenings, people hear a cry that comes from the oak.They say it is the girl wailing for her dead father.Antanas, 6 a cl.,12 years old             The Oak of the Devil   Long ago in a deep ooze there lived the Devil. He enjoyed food, and thatis why others called him ` Fatty`!  Once, the Fatty ran out of food and steppedinto the god Perkunas garden. He picked up some vegetables and startedeating. The god Perkunas (Thunder) saw the Fatty and was enraged:  ` How dare you to eat things from my garden!!`   The Thunder turned vegetables into a sack of acorns. The Fatty grabbed the sack and ran away. The Thunder went after him, but in vain. As TheDevil ran, he last all his acorns. That is why Silute is full of oaks.                        Gabriele, 6a cl., 12 y.old.</pre><p><hr><h3> See the Student's Art Work of the Pagryniu Oak:<br><A HREF="gabriele.html">Gabriele</A><br><A HREF="henriko.html">Henrikas</A><br><A HREF="edgar.html">Edgaras</A><br><A HREF="v%26g.html">Viktorija and Gintare</A><br><A HREF="ruta.html">Ruta</A><br><A HREF="andrius.html">Andrius</A><br><A HREF="evelina.html">Evelina</A><br><p><p><p><p><hr><p><p><p><p><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><p><center><A Href="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><center>Please send e-mail to: June Julian <A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">  jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

Once thought to be extinct,it was found in fossilized form in Japan, 1941.  It was then found growing wildin China.  The species is over 50 million years old.  It was introduced to theU.S. and Europe in 1948, and since has become a favorite ornamental tree.Bonsai techniques work excellent with this tree.  This Dawn Redwood was one ofthe first in the United States.  It is approximately 50 years old.  It islocated at Schoepfle's Garden in Birmingham, Ohio.  This beautiful garden beganin 1936 by Otto B. Schoepfle and was donated to Lorain County Metro Parks in1969.  This photo was taken in February 2000, notice it is without foliage.  Itis one of few cone-bearing deciduous trees.  It is a member of the Redwoodfamily (Taxodiaceae), which also includes the Bald Cypress; the two are veryclosely related.  The foliage starts very bright green and feather like inspring, and turns a beautiful golden in the fall before it dr!!ops its needles.  I've had the pleasure of planting hundreds of these ancienttrees, I can't wait to see them grow up!"        <br>        -Julie Gladney        </h3>        <pre>        </pre>        <h3>&copy; Julie Gladney<br>        "Metasequoia"<br>Color Photo        </h3>        <h4> Common Name: Dawn Redwood<br>        Latin Name: <i> Metasequoia Glyptostrobodies</i><br>        Location: Birmingham, Ohio USA</h4>        <pre>        </pre>        <A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A> Return toMain        Page        <br><br><p><p><center><A        HREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p>        <center>Please send e-mail to: June Julian<A        HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu"> jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>        </HTML>

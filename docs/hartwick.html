Most of this state was clear-cut lumbered inthe 1800s(more money was made in the Michigan timber industry in the1800s than in the Gold Rush of the same dates - an amazing, sad, but true fact).  Hope this helps with your project.<p> Marcia<br> tannerm@scnc.okemos.k12.mi.us<br></h3><p><p><A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif" align=left></A>Return to Main Page<br><center><A HREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">June Julian jj68@nyu.edu</center></A>

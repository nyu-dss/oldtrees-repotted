A guess at the tree's circumferenceis 85 inches and this particular tree is located atthe Howard Johnsons in Panama City Beach, Florida. Palm trees can grow up to 20 meters and this one wasaround 12 meters high so it is difficult to determineits age.   I really like the look of Palm trees and Ichose this tree because one year a friend of minedared me to try to climb a Palm Tree on spring break.In doing so, one of my roommates took a picture on mycamera without me knowing it.  It was so memorable andfunny at the time, that now I climb a Palm tree and geta picture taken every beach trip.  Somethinginteresting that I had only learned this summer isthat the bark on a Palm Tree are actually the driedleaves that have been trimmed.  And in tourist areasyou will see the bark trimmed so closely that itappears smooth and only towards the top of the treeyou can see the dried spike-like leaves.<br> -Brenda Bills</h3> <pre> </pre> <h3>&copy; Brenda Bills<br> "Panama City Palm"<br>  </h3> <h4> Common Name: Palm Tree<br> Latin Name: <i> Bismarkia nobilis </i><br> Circumference: approx 85 inches<br> Location: Panama City Beach, Florida USA</h4> <pre> </pre> <A HREF="index-2.html"><img src="sparklea.gif"align=left></A> Return to Main Page <br><br><p><p><center><AHREF="comment.html">Comments</A></center><p><p><p> <center>Please send e-mail to: June Julian<AHREF="mailto:jj68@nyu.edu">jj68@nyu.edu</center></A> </HTML>
